#📊 Sales EDA Dashboard – Project Overview
#🎯 Objective

The goal of this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to understand how different business factors — such as product categories, customer behavior, sales volume, profitability, and time-based trends — impact overall performance.
The dashboard helps uncover patterns, compare product segments, identify top customers, and analyze profit margins to support data-driven decisions.

#🔍 Key Questions Explored in the EDA
#1️⃣ What is the distribution of Sales?

Visual: Histogram
Understand how sales values are spread across all transactions and identify whether the distribution is skewed toward high or low spenders.

#2️⃣ How much quantity is sold over time?

Visual: Line Chart (Time Series)
Shows purchasing trends and seasonal fluctuations, helping spot peaks, drops, and sales cycles.

#3️⃣ Which products generate the highest profit?

Visual: Bar Chart
Compare total profit across all products to find top-performing and low-performing items.

#4️⃣ How do Sales and Profit relate to each other?

Visual: Scatter Plot + Trendline
Reveal whether higher sales consistently lead to higher profit and detect margins that vary by product.

#5️⃣ Which categories and products dominate overall revenue?

Visual: Enhanced Treemap (Sales + Profit + Margin)
A hierarchical visual breakdown showing:

Category contribution

Product contribution

Profit

Profit Margin

Percentage share

This helps quickly identify high-value segments.

#6️⃣ What does the Profit Margin distribution look like?

Visual: Histogram
Understand how efficiently each product or category converts revenue into profit.

#7️⃣ Who are the Top Customers driving Sales?

Visual: Bar Chart
Identify high-value customers who bring the most sales and might be worth special focus (retention or targeted marketing).

#8️⃣ How are Sales distributed by Category?

Visual: Pie Chart
Evaluate the share of each category in total purchases to see which group dominates or underperforms.

#9️⃣ What are the key statistical properties of Sales data?

Visual: Statistical Summary Table
Shows mean, median, standard deviation, max/min values, variation, etc., giving a quick numeric understanding of the dataset.

#🔟 What insights can be derived overall?

Insights Summary (Auto-Generated)
Highlights core findings such as:

Correlation between Sales and Profit
